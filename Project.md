# STCMS - Modern PHP Hybrid CMS Library

> **NOTE:**

## Project Goals & Philosophy

STCMS is a Composer-installable PHP library for building modern, component-based frontends for GEMVC (or any API backend), using Twig for server-side templates and React (via Vite) for interactive UI components. It is designed for:
- Hybrid rendering (SEO-friendly, fast, and interactive)
- Security and maintainability
- Extensibility for both PHP and frontend developers
- Standardized project initialization and structure

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Twig** for server-side rendering of pages and templates
- **React** for interactive UI, mounted via a registry-based system (`assets/js/registry.js`)
- **Vite** for fast development and production builds of frontend assets
- **.htaccess** and **index.php** for routing, security, and application bootstrapping
- **Symfony Cache, Dotenv, Console, Filesystem, Guzzle, Twig** (all included via Composer)

## Key Concepts

- **Registry-based React mounting:** All React components are registered in `assets/js/registry.js` and auto-mounted by `app.jsx`.
- **Hybrid rendering:** Use Twig for server-side, React for client-side interactivity.
- **Modern workflow:** Vite for frontend, Composer for backend, standardized setup.
- **Security:** .htaccess for routing, security headers, and static asset caching; index.php for app bootstrapping.
